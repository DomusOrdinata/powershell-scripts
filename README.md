# 🛠️ PowerShell Script Collection

Welcome to my (ever-growing) **collection of publicly available PowerShell scripts**! If you’ve landed here, you probably want to get things done faster, automate some mind-numbing tasks, or just poke around under the hood of Windows like a proper IT wizard. 🧙‍♂️

This repo is a grab bag of useful, time-saving, and occasionally opinionated PowerShell scripts that I’ve found handy over the years. Whether you’re a sysadmin, a dev, or someone who just really hates clicking through the same dialog boxes every day, you’ll probably find something you like here.

## 🚀 Why This Exists

Because life is too short for repetitive tasks. These scripts are designed to:
- Automate the boring stuff
- Solve real-world problems (not just “Hello, World!”)
- Make your Windows (and sometimes Azure/AD) management life easier

## 📦 What’s Inside?

Here’s a quick peek at what you’ll find (see the `powershell-scripts/` folder for the goods):

- `EntraIDCutover.ps1`: Perform the cutover from Hybrid to Entra ID.
- *And more! I add new scripts whenever inspiration (or frustration) strikes...*

## 🏁 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo**

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/DomusOrdinata/powershell-scripts.git

2. **Run a script**

    Open PowerShell as admin (sometimes needed!) and run:
    ```shell
    .\powershell-scripts\Entra-ID\EntraIDCutover.ps1

3. **Edit and Tweak**

    Most scripts have comments and customizable variables at the top. Don’t be shy—make them your own!

## 📋 Requirements

- Windows 10/11, Server 2016+
- PowerShell 7.5+ (but most work in PS7/Core too)
- Some scripts may require elevated/admin rights (I’ll let you know in the script header)
- If you break your system, you get to keep both pieces. 😅

## 🧑‍💻 Contributing

Spot a bug? Have a better/faster/stronger way to do something? PRs, issues, and suggestions are always welcome! Just keep it positive and constructive—this is a judgment-free zone (unless you use tabs instead of spaces).

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
These scripts should work, but no guarantees. Test in a lab before you unleash them on anything mission-critical. Use at your own risk, and don’t blame me if you accidentally delete C:\Windows. 😉
